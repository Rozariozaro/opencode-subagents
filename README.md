## Overview

This project implements a **6-agent, 6-skill OpenCode system** with strict separation of concerns, deterministic delegation, and strong quality gates. It is designed for:

- 🍎 iOS / macOS development
- 🔀 Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects
- 🖥️ Backend services
- 🐳 Docker / DevOps workflows
- 📦 Long-lived, modular codebases
- 🤖 AI-assisted development at scale

The system enforces a **read-before-write discipline**, routes all implementations through a dedicated reviewer, and restricts each agent to only the permissions it needs — preventing hallucination, scope creep, and accidental damage.

**Execution flow**: Orchestrator → Explore/Websearch → Plan → Implement → Review → (Doc-write) → Report

## Agents

| Agent | Mode | Model | Temp | Role |
|-------|------|-------|------|------|
| `orchestrator` | primary | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6` | 0.1 | Central coordinator; analyzes intent, plans, delegates, verifies |
| `explore` | subagent | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5` | 0.0 | Read-only analyst; discovers architecture, traces dependencies, identifies conventions |
| `implementer` | subagent | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6` | 0.2 | Code executor; writes/edits code, runs builds/tests, reports outcomes |
| `reviewer` | subagent | `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6` | 0.1 | Quality gate; validates correctness, consistency, maintainability, safety |
| `doc-writer` | subagent | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5` | 0.2 | Documentation maintainer; updates changelogs, READMEs, and docs only |
| `websearch` | subagent | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6` | 0.1 | Technical research analyst; framework comparisons, OSS discovery, API research |

### Agent Responsibilities

#### 🎯 Orchestrator
The only primary agent. Owns the full 7-phase workflow. Has **no edit permissions** — it cannot write code, only plan and delegate.

#### 🔍 Explore
Read-only codebase analyst. Discovers architecture, traces call graphs, identifies conventions and patterns. **Temperature 0.0** for maximum determinism.

#### 🔨 Implementer
Executes implementation plans precisely. Has edit + guarded bash permissions. Follows orchestrator plans — does not make architecture decisions.

#### 🔬 Reviewer
Quality gate using the most capable model (Opus). Read-only — cannot fix issues directly, only approve or reject with structured feedback. Catches bugs, security issues, and architectural drift.

#### 📝 Doc-Writer
Restricted to documentation files only. Activated only after reviewer approval. Cannot touch source code.

#### 🌐 Websearch
Web-fetch only, no local file access. Used for framework comparisons, API version checks, OSS discovery, and deprecation validation.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `diagnose` | "debug this", "diagnose", bug reports | 5-phase loop: reproduce → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix |
| `zoom-out` | "zoom out", unfamiliar code section | Architectural mapping; shows broader context, callers, dependencies |
| `graphify` | knowledge graph requests | Generates HTML + JSON knowledge graphs with community detection |
| `websearch` | research, compare, find, investigate | Senior technical research analyst skill |
| `handoff` | session wrap-up, context handoff | Compacts conversation into structured handoff document |
| `grill-with-docs` | stress-test a plan, "grill me" | Challenges plans against domain model and existing documentation |

## Workflow

The orchestrator follows a strict **7-phase execution model**:

```
Phase 1: Analysis      → Parse intent, identify ambiguities, estimate complexity
Phase 2: Exploration   → @explore (codebase) and/or @websearch (external)
Phase 3: Planning      → Synthesize findings into explicit implementation plan
Phase 4: Implementation→ @implementer with full plan + context + validation commands
Phase 5: Review        → @reviewer sees ALL changes before anything is marked done
Phase 6: Documentation → @doc-writer only after reviewer approval
Phase 7: Reporting     → Summarize changes, caveats, follow-up items
```

### Parallel Delegation Rules
- ✅ Explore + Websearch can run in parallel (independent, no shared state)
- ✅ Independent implementation subtasks can run in parallel (no file overlap)
- ❌ Review is always sequential (must see all changes holistically)
- ❌ Doc-writer never runs in parallel with reviewer

## Permission Matrix

| Agent | Read | Edit | Bash | Delegate | Web | Skills |
|-------|------|------|------|----------|-----|--------|
| Orchestrator | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (git read-only) | ✅ | ❌ | All |
| Explore | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (git/grep only) | ❌ | ❌ | graphify, zoom-out, diagnose |
| Implementer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (guarded) | ❌ | ✅ | — |
| Reviewer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (git/grep only) | ❌ | ❌ | zoom-out, graphify |
| Doc-Writer | ✅ (docs only) | ✅ (docs only) | ❌ (git/grep only) | ❌ | ❌ | — |
| Websearch | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | — |

> **Notes:** Bash permissions are restricted per agent — Orchestrator allows only read-only git commands; Explore, Reviewer, and Doc-Writer allow only `git`, `grep`, and `find`; Implementer has guarded bash (destructive operations require confirmation). The Implementer also has web-fetch access for documentation lookups during implementation.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Explore separated from implementer | Forces "read before write" discipline; prevents hallucinated implementations |
| Reviewer is read-only | Prevents "fixing" issues directly; ensures structured, actionable feedback |
| Doc-writer restricted to docs files | Prevents accidental source code modification during documentation passes |
| Orchestrator has no edit permissions | Prevents bypassing the delegation workflow; enforces separation of concerns |
| Temperature 0.0 for explore | Maximizes determinism and reproducibility in codebase analysis |
| Max 2 retry cycles | Prevents infinite loops; escalates to user after repeated failures |
| Reviewer uses Opus (most capable model) | Quality gate deserves the highest-capability model; catches subtle bugs |

## Benchmark Results

Validated on a real iOS project (FoodNutritions):

| Task Complexity | Single Agent | Multi-Agent | Winner | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Simple (read-only) | Fast, accurate | Adds overhead | Single agent | No delegation needed for trivial tasks |
| Medium (1-file impl) | Missed 1 bug | Caught all bugs | **Multi-agent** | +1 critical bug caught by reviewer |
| Complex (multi-file) | Missed 3 bugs | Caught all bugs | **Multi-agent** | +3 blocking bugs caught |

**ROI**: ~3K tokens of orchestration overhead pays for itself on medium+ complexity tasks.

Test suite: 12 benchmark cases (T01–T12) defined in `AGENT_BENCHMARK.md` covering:
- Full workflow validation
- Skill trigger accuracy
- Permission boundary enforcement
- Rejection cycle handling
- Doc-writer activation conditions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed
- GitHub Copilot or Anthropic API access (for Claude models)
- Node.js (for zod validation plugin)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rozariozaro/opencode-subagents.git
cd your-project
cp -r opencode-subagents/.opencode .
cp opencode-subagents/opencode.json .
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd .opencode && npm install
```

3. Start OpenCode:
```bash
opencode
```

The orchestrator agent will be your primary entry point. All other agents are invoked automatically as subagents.

### Configuration

Edit `opencode.json` to set your preferred default model:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "google/gemini-3.5-flash"
}
```

Agent models are configured individually in `.opencode/agents/*.md` frontmatter.
